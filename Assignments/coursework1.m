%Discussion  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The waveform in Figure2 has multiple (local) minimums 
% and maximums, this is a result of adding multiple sinewaves together 
% that have different amplitudes and frequencies. 
% It can be seen from the Figure2 that waveform is beginning to take the
% form of a squarewave (e.g. we can see a half cycle where x is 0.4 to 0.6V
% between 0 and 0.005, with the other half at about -0.4 to -0.6V 
% from 0.005 to 1)

%Since a squarewave is an infinite series of sinewave harmonics, 
% we can approximate a squarewave by adding together multiple odd sinewaves
% with diminishing amplitudes and increasing frequencies.

%The fundamental frequency is 100Hz, this frequency will be a factor of
% each harmonic frequency. Since 2/3pi and 2/5pi are odd sinewaves (with
% 3*100 and 5*100 frequencies), these meet the requirement to approximate a
% square wave when combined, which is what we are seeing here. 
% Adding further harmonics (2/7pi(V) at 700Hz, 2/9pi(V) at 900Hz for
% example) will further steepen the rise/fall between each half-cycle, as
% well as flatten further the local minimums and maximums within each
% half-cycle â€“ in other words, as we add more harmonics the wave will begin 
% to have a constant amplitude of 25V for 0.005s, and constant -25V for
% another 0.005s

%{
 from figures (1) and (2) the effect of the 5V DC offset is visible,
 with every value v(t) shifted by 5V, hence the new maximimum point
 (amplitude) is 15V (previously it was 10V) and the new minimum point is
 5V (previously 0V)

 The DC component is also the mean of a waveform, hence adding 5V DC to
 this waveform, gives a new mean of v_mean+ 5 also

 mathematically, since the sawtooth wave is given as:
        v(t) = (E/T) * t [1]

 given that the mean of a waveform is defined as:
    v_mean = (1/T) * integral(v(t)^2) [2] (integrate w.r.t t, over 0:T)

 when [1] is subsituted [2] , we are left with:
    v_mean = E/2

 therefore adding a DC offset:
    v(t) = E0 + (E1/T) * t
    v_mean = E0 + (E1/2)

  hence the overall shift of 5V in this example

%{
This is as close to a mathematial 'proof' that matlab comments allow:

RMS for a waveform is given as below:
 rms = sqrt( (1/T) * integral(u(t)^2) ) [1]
 where:
   T is the period 
   u(t) is the wave function
for a bipolar square wave, we have:
    u1(t) = Vp for t = [0:t1]
    u2(t) = -Vp] for t = [t1:T]
        where [0:t1] is a half cycle

therefore, from eq.1 (integral wrt t)
    u1_rms = sqrt( (1/T) * integral(Vp^2) ) [2]
which reduces to:
    u1_rms^2  = (1/T) * (Vp^2) * (t1 - 0)
hence:
    u1_rms = Vp * sqrt(t1/T)
since t1/T is D, the duty cycle, and for a square wave with duty cycle
50%:
    u1_rms = Vp * sqrt(1) = Vp

Similarly, equation [2] can be adapted for u2_rms, to give:
    u2_rms^2  = (1/T) * ((-Vp)^2) * (T - t1)

with the rms for the full cycle then given as:
    u_rms = sqrt( u1_rms^2 + u2_rms^2 ) = Vp
%}

%redefine t and show mathemtically rms = E = 25
t = linspace(0,T, length(vp)); %redefine t for just one cycle
u = vp;
% from equations above, u_rms is given by:
u_rms = sqrt( (1/T) * trapz(t,u.^2) ); %trapz will approximate the integral

% verify with Matlab's rms
u_rms_mat = rms(u);
